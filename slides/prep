We start with the @03limit@00 definition of a derivative and our function,
which we will call @24f@00(x).#

So, we have our goal:#

@27d/dx @21xⁿ@27 = nxⁿ¯¹@00#

Our function:#

@24f@27(x) = @21xⁿ@00#

And the @03limit@00 definition of that function's derivative:#

@24f@26'@27(x) =  @03@02lim@08@07  ( @24f@27(x + @25h@27) - @24f@27(x) ) / @25h@27
         @25@03@02h@27->0@08@07
@00
@03^ This will be our first step.@00
