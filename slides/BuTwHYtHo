...but why?#
Why the power rule proof?#
You could've chosen the @03product rule@00,#
@03quotient rule@00...#

I probably don't have to tell you this, but the
POWER rule sounds pretty cool, rather -# POWER#ful# (amiright?).#

In all seriousness, I chose it because it's absolutely
fundamental to a majority of differentiations
(that I've come across in my naive experience).#

The rule you use to prove it is also quite fascinating,
as [SPOILERS] we get to represent an infinite number of
variables.
