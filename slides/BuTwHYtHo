Why the power rule proof?#
You could've chosen the @03product rule@00,#
@03quotient rule@00...#
@03@02Well, I didn't do @01that@07@02 one because support for
mathematical expressions in terminals begins and ends with unicode/ASCII...@00#

I probobly don't have to tell you this, but the
POWER rule sounds pretty cool, rather -# POWER#ful# (amiright?).#

In all seriousness, I chose it because it's absolutely
fundamental to a majority of differentions
(that I've come across in my naive experience).#

The rule you use to prove it is also quite facinating,
as [SPOILERS] we get to represent an infinate number of
variables.
