...but why?#
Why the power rule proof?#
You could've chosen the @03quotient rule@00,#
@03product rule@00...#
Well, I didn't do the quotient rule because terminals
only support fractions as far as unicode goes...#

I probobly don't have to tell you this, but the
POWER rule sounds pretty cool, rather -# POWER#ful# (amiright?).#

In all seriousness, I chose it because it's absolutely
fundamental to a majority of differentions
(that I've come across in my naive experience).#

The rule you use to prove it is also quite facinating,
as [SPOILERS] we get to represent an infinate number of
variables.
