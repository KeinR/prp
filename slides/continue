Now we can complete step 3 by expanding the binomial:

3.
f'(x) =  lim  ( xⁿ + nxⁿ-¹h + h²E - xⁿ ) / h
         h->0

We can cancel out xⁿ (xⁿ - xⁿ)

4.

f'(x) =  lim  ( nxⁿ-¹h + h²E ) / h
         h->0

Now, to finally remove that pesky h in the denominator,
we factor out h from the numerator and cancel out h.

4.

f'(x) =  lim  h( nxⁿ-¹ + hE ) / h
         h->0

f'(x) =  lim  nxⁿ-¹ + hE
         h->0

At this point, we can safely use direct substitution to solve the limit,
setting h to zero:

5.

f'(x) = nxⁿ-¹

QED! That's the proof!

d/dx xⁿ = nxⁿ-¹
